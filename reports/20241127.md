**Team Report: Filled out by each member**

- We have finished implementing some features, such as sign up/sign in distinction, add shop refactoring, refactoring the frontend codebase, and recognizing inappropriate text.

- We are still working on image integration, as there were some issues with authentication and connecting to the blob storage via our code. We learned that there needs to be separate access assigned to whoever is accessing the blob storage, even if they are the owner. There were also some issues with how we should store each business details in the backend, and how that data transfer would work. We did some brainstorming on how to store the data, and our database schema to figure out the best way to handle business details. Overall, working in pairs was helpful and we were able to get a lot of things done.

- Next week, we want to continue working on our tasks:

  - Ailsa: Responsible for making the backend server routes for image interactions, and reformatting it. Hope to get it done by Weds next week.

  - Kevin: Responsible for rendering a user‚Äôs business page dependent on whether they already have a store or not. The owner of the store should be able to edit their store.

  - Sean: Responsible for the login system, including separating sign up and log in as well as implementing JWT tokens.

  - Aaditya: Helping frontend team with backend integration, and refining routes.
  - Katharine: create components to send multiple images to server for add business, make component for single image + caption for adding photos in their business page, & getting the business page banner photo, business photos, and individual homepage business photo icons to be displayed.

**Individual Team Members:  Filled out by each member**

**Ailsa:**

- My goal for the week was to set up a connection between our server and the blob storage.

- This was successful! I learned a lot about how to integrate blob storage, as well as how blobs are organized within the Azure Blob Storage (container, storage account, blob). There are a lot of different configurations and options that you can use, which is nice. I also learned that there is a direct API to call blobs, but that it would be better for our design to leverage clients and interact with our storage that way. However, this week was a bit busy for me so I wasn‚Äôt able to get as much done as I expected. I plan to do a lot of work over the weekend!

- Next week, I want to set up all the functionality, including retrieving one blob image, retrieving a list of images, and uploading. I also want to reorganize the blob routes, and help frontend with image integration.¬†

  - Routes for various image retrievals: 1 day

  - Route for uploading images, and processing: 1 day

  - Reorganizing routes to follow our directory structure: 1 day

  - Help integrate it with frontend: 1 day

**Sean:**

- My goal for the week was to separate our current login system into two separate parts, sign up and log in, and implement JWT tokens for security

- I was able to accomplish separating our login system, as the logic was very similar to our existing system but is now organized into 3 methods: One for communicating with google to get user information, one for sign up, and one for log in. I was also able to thoroughly comment these functions for readability in the future

- For implementing JWT token for security, I was able to create and send tokens to the front end and store them in local storage, as well as send them with future requests for verification on the back end. I had trouble passing the token through authentication headers to the backend. I learned a lot about the best practices when using JWTs as well as the different methods available in the jsonwebtoken library

- For next week, I want to finish implementing JWTs by storing the auth token in state and the refresh token in httpsonly cookies on the front end. Additionally, I want to implement a middleware on the backend that will create a new auth token if the refresh token is not expired. If the refresh token is expired, I want to sign the user out and prompt them to login again. Because of this, I would also like to implement a simple logout button on the front end on the profile page as I think the functionality will be similar. I hope to comment all this thoroughly for readability. Finally, if I complete my other tasks, I would like to work on some route testing for the front end¬†

**Kevin:**

- My goal for the week was to implement a feature on the homepage where clicking on a store redirects users to the seller's store page. The page displays the store's description and contact information, along with tabs for navigating between ‚ÄúBasics,‚Äù ‚ÄúOthers,‚Äù and ‚ÄúPictures‚Äù.

- I successfully implemented the redirection feature, allowing users to navigate from the homepage to the store's dedicated page. On the store page, I displayed the seller's description and contact information dynamically. What I had difficulty with was implementing the tabs to render the specific content dependent on the tab clicked. This was resolved through research by YouTube videos. I also had difficulties with CSS as occasionally a horizontal scrollbar would appear or two vertical scrollbars would appear. This was resolved by using StackOverflow forums that had similar issues with the CSS of a webpage.

- For next week, I plan to implement functionality for editing shops, allowing users to make updates to their store details. I also want to check whether a user already has a business. If they do, their business page will render automatically when they go to their business page; if not, they will be prompted to create a new store.

**Aadi:**

- My goal for this week was to integrate the feature on the homepage such that additional information about the shop is shown with Kevin. Secondly, I also had the task of working more on route tests on the backend as well as fixing up aspects of continuous integration with Ailsa. Finally, I also had the task of connecting and fixing the ‚ÄúAdd Your Business‚Äù page with Cindy, replacing placeholder values for the demo into the real values

- I was able to accomplish all of these tasks, writing additional backend routes, documenting their code as well as writing some frontend code to grab the necessary information. Moreover, I figured out the issue we were having with our test system (it is run using mocks instead of stubs, making get requests for an already existing piece of data difficult to work with). I worked on an additional feature, a middleware filter made using Gemini AI API that detects any offensive/inappropriate content entered by the user and pushed that onto the aadi/aistuff branch on our backend GitHub repo.

- For next week, I plan on working closely with Cindy and Kevin to finish off functionality for deleting, editing and viewing your own business as well as different error handling on the frontend based on the code as well as error message they receive back.

**Katharine:**
- my goal for this week was to create the image uploading component which I did.
- I was able to accomplish successfully creating a dummy image upload for frontned
- Next week, I will use the dummy component I made to create custom multi-image uploads and singluar image + caption upload components. Then I will also try my best to display those images saved in server into their corresponding pages.
