**Team Report:**

We continued working on our goals outlined from last week. Most of the work is front end now, as we are polishing up the basic functionality and design. We also did work on the sign up process, implementing login features. Backend did write a few tests, and implement some additional features to support login/security. Moving forward, we hope to finish up image integration with frontend (our main goal), and probably clean up some CSS. 

**Individual Contributions:**

**Ailsa:**

- I finished the routes in the backend for image integration. We are now able to retrieve and upload images from the server. 

- This weekend, I’ll work on supporting frontend to help implement the server routes, and try to host our server. However, I’m still waiting for frontend to confirm that the server routes work (will hopefully be done by Thursday)

**Aadi**:

- I worked further with Cindy and Sean to fix up a few remaining bugs in our backend and frontend pertaining to deleting businesses as well as the sign up procedure. Moreover, I wrote additional route tests for our backend, testing some of our shop routes using httpMocks.

- This weekend, I will support frontend on adding some finishing touches to the CSS as well as refine all of our features and prepare for the final presentation.

**Sean:**

- I worked with Aadi and Cindy to dynamically assign the owner of a created shop to be whoever is logged in. I also finished implementing refresh tokens and storing them in httpOnly cookies. This allowed me to update the signedIn state so that the user stays signed for 24 hours after their most recent login or until they decide to log out. I also added a log out button under the profile tab that clears the localstorage and cookies and routes the user back to the log in page. I also went through all our github issues on the front and back end repo’s and closed all the ones that could be resolved.

- This week, I will implement front end route tests, finish commenting all my code, resolve all remaining github issues, and support other people creating our last remaining features before final release.


**Kevin:**

- My goal for the week was to implement an edit button and create functionality to check whether a user already has a business. If a user already has a business, their business page would render automatically when they navigate to it. Otherwise, they would be prompted to create a new store.

- With Cindy’s help the functionality to check whether a user has an existing business and redirect accordingly was successfully implemented however, I was unable to complete the edit button. This was due to time constraints from working on another project in a different class and encountering issues with getting the edit button to save changes correctly.

- The challenges included debugging the save functionality and ensuring that updates to the business details were properly reflected in the system. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to resolve these issues within the week.

- For next week, I plan to prioritize finishing the edit button functionality and when that is completed work on finishing touches on CSS.

**Katharine:**
- My goal for this week is to save image into the server and get image into the server. Specifically, I hope by tonight I can successfully save a singular image into our blob server and get a singular image from server. Then on Friday - Sunday, I want to start do multi-image file saves and retrievals.

- The challeneges I faced this week is finals. But I will be cracking down on it by tonight.

- For next week, it will be final release. Therefore, I hope to maybe work on updating the documentation as well.

**Cindy:**
- I worked with Sean to dynamically assign stores to users with an account on the login page and modified the CSS to make the page look more visually appealing. I also worked with Aadi on the "Add Your Business" page to dynamically detect inappropriate content from users. If inappropriate content is detected, the "Add Business" process will fail, and front end will output a message telling user to submit again.
  
- For the rest of the week, I will continue fixing the CSS for the "Add Business" page. I encounter the most problems with CSS, as the code I write doesn’t produce the desired output.
