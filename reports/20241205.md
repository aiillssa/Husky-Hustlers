**Team Report:**

We continued working on our goals outlined from last week. Most of the work is front end now, as we are polishing up the basic functionality and design. We also did work on the sign up process, implementing login features. Backend did write a few tests, and implement some additional features to support login/security. Moving forward, we hope to finish up image integration with frontend (our main goal), and probably clean up some CSS. 

**Individual Contributions:**

**Ailsa:**

- I finished the routes in the backend for image integration. We are now able to retrieve and upload images from the server. 

- This weekend, I’ll work on supporting frontend to help implement the server routes, and try to host our server. However, I’m still waiting for frontend to confirm that the server routes work (will hopefully be done by Thursday)

**Aadi**:

- I worked further with Cindy and Sean to fix up a few remaining bugs in our backend and frontend pertaining to deleting businesses as well as the sign up procedure. Moreover, I wrote additional route tests for our backend, testing some of our shop routes using httpMocks.

- This weekend, I will support frontend on adding some finishing touches to the CSS as well as refine all of our features and prepare for the final presentation.

**Sean:**

- I worked with Aadi and Cindy to dynamically assign the owner of a created shop to be whoever is logged in. I also finished implementing refresh tokens and storing them in httpOnly cookies. This allowed me to update the signedIn state so that the user stays signed for 24 hours after their most recent login or until they decide to log out. I also added a log out button under the profile tab that clears the localstorage and cookies and routes the user back to the log in page. I also went through all our github issues on the front and back end repo’s and closed all the ones that could be resolved.

- This week, I will implement front end route tests, finish commenting all my code, resolve all remaining github issues, and support other people creating our last remaining features before final release.
